The Avenger Social Media is my first full stack website project that utilizes ReactJS, MongoDB, Express, and NodeJS.

This website is similar to StackOverFlow where the user can create their developer profile. The profile will include their education, their experience, their social medias and their skills.

Moreover, this project also supports the news feed functionality where the user can see other developers' posts and comment anything they like.

In the future, I will further improve the UI and add more functionalities such as ChatBox, Notification, Uploading Videos and Images.
